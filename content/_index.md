      Welcome to the world according to Albert. This is my blog and professional profile, and now a bit about me:
      I currently have five years of commercial development experience. My expertise is mostly in back-end development through Azure. 
      However, I also have experience with developing native applications for desktops and android devices and I''ve also dabbled in infra ops through terraform.
